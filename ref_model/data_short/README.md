STATEMENT:
1. I used prompt input "Lebron James is", the Encoded_ID is 1 9388 1617 5011 338. Thus, the input length before the prefill stage is 5. During the decoding stage, this length becomes 6, as one new ID is generated by the prefill stage. Make sure to set p_id to 6 accordingly.

2. The quantized weight file includes both the scale and the quantized matrix. The quantized matrix is already represented in ap_uint<> data type for convenience.

3. All the float values are represented with a precision of 12 decimal places.

4. hidden_states represents the input before layer 0 of the decoding stage (you should use this as your input), while ground_truth is the accurate output after the self-attention part of layer 0. You can use ground_truth as a benchmark to compare with your output after optimization.
